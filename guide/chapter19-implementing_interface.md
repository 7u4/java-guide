# Implementing Interface
Interfaces one of the tent pole concept of Java, so a designer of library/application
you have a large choice when you want to implement an interface.

```java
## Structural Types
### lambda
### method reference
```

```java
## Class-like
### record
### enum
### class
### local class
```

```java
## Abstract Class
```

```java
## Dynamic Proxy
```


```java
## But everything is not an interface
```
