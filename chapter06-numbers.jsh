// # Numbers
// This chapter in not specific to Java but more on how integers and floating point numbers
// works on CPUs like Intel 64 bits or ARM 64 bits.


// ## Integers
// Given that integers are represented using a fixed number of bits,
// there is a minimum/maximum number that can be represented
System.out.println("max " + Integer.MAX_VALUE);
System.out.println("min " + Integer.MIN_VALUE);

// integers can overflow, if a positive integers is too big, it becomes negative
System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1);

// and vice versa
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1);

// In Java, you have safe alternatives that are slower but throw an exception
// if the computation overflow
Math.addExact(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 1);
Math.subtractExact(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1);

// If you try to divide by 0, you get an exception
1 / 0
1 % 0   // remainder of the division


// ## Double precision floating point numbers
// The computation using floating point in not precise because not all values are
// directly representable so the CPU will use the closest value.
// It's like using 3.14 when you ask for Ï€

// So when you do a computation, the error propagates and becomes visible
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2);

// When you print a double, there is a trick, only some decimals will be printed
// so you may think the value is fully represented that but that's just an illusion
System.out.println(1.0 / 3.0);

// On way to see the trick is to ask a float, a 32 bits, to be printed as a double, 64 bits.
System.out.println(1.0f / 3.0f);
System.out.println(Float.toString(1.0f / 3.0f));
System.out.println(Double.toString(1.0f / 3.0f));  // damn i'm unmasked


// ### No exception
// The computation is said `secured` so instead of having an exception thrown
// when you divide by 0, you have three special values of double to represent the result
// of the computation

// +Infinity
System.out.println(1.0 / 0.0);
System.out.println(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);

// -Infinity
System.out.println(-1.0 / 0.0);
System.out.println(Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY);

// Not A Number
System.out.println(1.0 / 0.0);
System.out.println(Double.NaN);

// ### NaN
// Not a Number is very weird, because by definition, it's the number which is not equals to itself

// Don't use == to test NaN, it will not work
System.out.println(Double.NaN == Double.NaN);

// The only way to test is NaN is NaN is to test if it is equals to itself (by definition)
boolean isNotANumber(double x) {
  return x != x;
}
System.out.println(isNotANumber(Double.NaN));

// The method isNotANumber already exist in Double, `Double.isNaN()`
System.out.println(Double.isNaN(Double.NaN));


// ### Record and NaN
// When using an equals() to test if two double values are equals, the implementation
// of record as a special case so if the content is two NaNs, it works ! 
// 
record MagicBeer(double content) { }
var beer1 = new MagicBeer(Double.NaN);
var beer2 = new MagicBeer(Double.NaN);
System.out.println(beer1.equals(beer2));
